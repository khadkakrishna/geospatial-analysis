### Scope of Geospatial Data Analysis
>Innovation and cutting-edge research and development (R&D) in the field of geospatial data, geospatial science, and analytics continue to yield new ways to incorporate geospatial data into new arenas and offer solutions to todayâ€™s most challenging problems. 
Some of the most important aspects of use are:
 - Retail: Amazon, Walmart, Google etc. uses data for retail purpose
 - Health Care: Research continues into the application of social geography and redefining health care from a model of treatment to a model of prevention and wellness.
 - Financial Services: The financial services industry, which traditionally consumes data in the form of dollars, cents, credits, and debts contained within spreadsheets, balance sheets, or financial statements, has discovered value in geospatial data.
 - Logistics/Transportation: geospatial data has been most commonly associated with transportation through the utilization of maps for navigation and transit.
